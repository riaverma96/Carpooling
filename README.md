# Carpooling
Carpooling is an interactive and innovative website for car owners and commuters who wish to carpool.

## How It Works
Users create `Request`s and `Offer`s. If a user wishes to book an `Offer`, he/she creates a `Booking`. The driver is then notified when he next logs in.

## Glossary
`Request` - created when a commuter would like a ride to be offered.
`Offer` - created when a driver has a ride and would like to look for commuters.
`Booking` - created when a commuter accepts an offer and pays the driver.
